# Repository policy audit

This package owns Mux UI's deterministic repository-policy checks. For delivery
work, begin with the repository [route map](../../../AGENTS.md), then read the
canonical Architecture, Roadmap, Product Scope, and relevant evidence owner.
The repository entrypoint audits navigation, ownership, generated output, and
artifact naming.

This package implements the root `pnpm check`, `pnpm check:all`, and
`pnpm release:prepare` commands. Their scopes and proof rules are in the root
route map's Verification section. The runner rejects a mix of component,
package, and file selectors, and scoped work needs no task-local operation
descriptor.

## Pull request CI routing

GitHub pull requests use `src/ci-impact.mjs` to plan checks from the merge-base
to head diff. The plan is printed as JSON before checks run. PR text and labels
do not establish ownership or narrow proof. Canonical React records, generated
Storybook page IDs, changed importer paths, and explicit owner routes determine
the checks; an unresolved path fails with a mapping diagnostic.

Component runtime and CSS changes select the affected React families, their
verified named test cases and browser proofs, and every Storybook page in those
families. A changed authored example or Storybook story export selects only its
canonical page ID. Theme/token changes run their compiler and projection checks
with theme color and contrast proofs, without component keyboard suites.
Documentation-only changes run the documentation owner. Catalog guide changes
run the catalog, documentation, and `@muxui/tooling` checks, because guide bytes
feed the catalog digest that the tooling dense goldens pin. Scale-only changes
run the theme-authoring checks, and Scale source also runs the documentation
owner that embeds it. Either route runs the Scale docs browser test, which
builds the docs site first. Repository-policy, workflow, policy-run fixture, and
retained evidence changes run the policy checks. Mixed changes combine and
deduplicate those scopes.

The PR planner prepares ignored React or Storybook metadata only when those
owners are needed to resolve canonical families or page IDs. A full workspace
plan is reserved for identified workspace-wide inputs such as the Node/pnpm
toolchain, workspace layout, or shared root dependency/engine fields. Lockfile
changes route through verified workspace importers; changes whose consumers
cannot be resolved fail with an actionable ownership error. Manual and
scheduled CI keep the explicit full graph and broad browser checks. Local
`pnpm check`, `pnpm check:all`, and generation commands keep their existing
semantics.

Evidence capture and disclosure remain owned by the architecture, Product Scope,
package, and evidence references. See
[`tests/evidence/README.md`](../../../tests/evidence/README.md) before retaining
proof.

## Identity-reset compatibility

`identityReset.current` is the live Mux UI identity. The audit rejects legacy
machine/display names, package scopes, namespaces, executable command tokens,
completion helpers, experimental namespaces, fixture keys, and historical
object keys in current sources. No public package API exposes a legacy alias or
compatibility mode.
